### 🔄 How They Work

- **Vented Dryers** pull in air, heat it, and blow it through the drum. Moist air is expelled through a duct to the outside.
- **Ventless Dryers** (condenser or heat pump models) recirculate heated air inside the drum. Moisture is condensed and collected in a tank or drained away—no external vent needed.
